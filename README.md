# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to gather earthquake data from the U.S. Geological Survey and display it with an interactive map. The map will display data for earthquakes, all and major, as well as tectonic plate info and will have three different map views to choose from. A legend will also be included with the map.
